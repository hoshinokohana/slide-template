## `Detection & Discrimination'

> `Detection` and `Discrimination` are fundamental cognitive processes to understand perception, decision-making and confidence

. . .

* Behavioral Aspects (Mazor, 2020)
  - Detection refers to stimulus is present or not
  - Discrimination refers to identifying specific attributes of stimulus

* Theoretical Aspects (King & Deheane, 2014)
  - Detection is often framed within SDT(Signal Detection Theory), separates sensitivity from decision criteria
  - Discrimination also framed within SDT, but focus on the ability to differenciate between different stimuli
. . .
 
## Metacognition:Definition and Mesurements (Fleming, 2023 & Dayan, 2023)

* Metacognition refers to the ability to reflect on and evaluate one's cognitive processes 

. . .

* Confidence is one of the key aspect, the assessment of one's own abilities and certainty in judgments or decisions.

. . .

* The neural basis of confidence
   - individual's internal states and beliefs about their cognitive processes.
   - Prefrontal Cortex is a key brain region related 

. . .

* The computational basis of confidence(different models to compute confidence)
   - First-order evidence accumulation, where sensory information is processed to form a judgment
   - Second-order metacognitive processes, which reflect on the first-order judgment to form a confidence estimate
  
. . .

What's the confidence on detection & discrimination task?

## Noise effect to confidence(Mazor, 2020)

![Figures for response conditional Type-2 ROC curves](index_files//Mazor.png)

* Metacognitive sensitivity quantified as the area under the ROC curve.(AUROC)
   - Significantly higher for 'yes' compared to 'no'
   - confidence ratings the presence are more accurate than ratings the absence for detection
   - confidence ratings the similar for discrimination

Results here shows the selective asymmetry in the fidelity of metacognitive evaluation following judgments about target absence.(Kanai, 2010)


## Hugo's insight

![detection](index_files/auroc2_det.png){width=6in}

![discrimination](index_files/auroc2_disc.png){width=6in}

AUROC per response for two tasks
:::
* Interests from Hugo's experiments
   - Confidence ratings for discrimination keep the similar pattern with Mazor's
   - Confidence ratings the absence are more accurate than ratings the presence, inverse from Mazor's
   - This experiment perform on a sample unbalanced dataset(environmental setting)

## The computational modelling measurements

To analyze the paradox of how stimuli objectively inversed for perceptual detection task

Taylor Webb's DNN helps us to certify the confidence rating for perceptual tasks

## Hypothesis

* ### The confidence levels in determing the presence or absence of objects may paradoxical affected by the levels of environmental settings in which the detection and discrimination tasks are performed.
   - Different rules for sample balancing reflects to different environmental settings
   - Perform the perceptual task on unblanced or different combinations for balancing could reflect different results
   - Aim to find the the computational and neural mechanisms of confidence
